   the /api/pix routes need.

   The connection string is SUPABASE_POOLER_URL, falling back to
   SUPABASE_DIRECT_CONNECTION_URL (Supabase dashboard → Connect). When neither
   is set the module stays inert and every helper reports "not configured"
   instead of throwing — the app has run without a database since day one and
   must keep working that way. Nothing in the poster pipeline should fail
   because storage is unavailable.

   Note on hosting: the *direct* connection is IPv6-only unless the IPv4 add-on
   is enabled, and it holds a real long-lived socket. That suits this
   long-running Node server (Railway/Docker). A serverless deploy (Netlify,

     happened to it, it is the wrong clock entirely. Measured against the live

     above, so every status tab behaves exactly as before.

     below, which is the whole change. Nulling the loser meant QA-B approving a
     post QA-A had rejected on Monday deleted A's name, A's timestamp and A's
     credit for the review: A's tally dropped overnight, A vanished from the
     reviewer leaderboard for a decision they did make, and — on a system whose

 * came back from a rejection rather than arriving fresh.
