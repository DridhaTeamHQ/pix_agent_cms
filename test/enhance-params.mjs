/* ── The server half of AI Enhance: cache identity and output shape ─────────

   Run: node test/enhance-params.mjs

   Every other test in this directory drives client geometry. Nothing covered
   the server, and the gap had a cost: `enhanceCacheKey` was handed the
   `{ buffer, mime }` wrapper that `readEnhanceEdit` resolves, passed it
   straight to `hash.update()`, and threw

       ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE — The "data" argument must be of type string or an
       instance of Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView. Received an instance of
       Object

   before OpenAI was ever called. Every masked expand 500d. The feature could
   not have worked on any deploy, and the first assertion below is three lines
   long.

   The second half holds down the output shape. `size` is chosen in the plan
   stage, the browser composites its frame at exactly that size, and stage 2
   validates it again on the way back — three places that have to agree. If
   they ever stop agreeing the model rescales the composite, which is the one
   thing compositing exists to prevent, so what is asserted is that every size
   the plan can emit is a size stage 2 will accept.                          */

/* ── Reframe: the job that regenerates ───────────────────────────────────

   Expand pins the original and bolts a generated margin to it. Every failure
   this route shipped was a failure of that bolt — the doubled subject, the
   framed print, the smeared sky. Reframe hands the model the picture and asks
   for it at the poster's shape, which is what the same model does well when it
   is asked plainly, and what the reviewer picked after comparing the two.

   It regenerates, so the things that keep it honest are worth pinning:
   it asks for the POSTER's shape (not the source's), it sends no mask (there
   is nothing to pin), and its prompt stays SHORT — the long one is not more
   careful, it is more contradictory, and contradiction is what makes a model
   hedge by handing back what it was given.                                  */
