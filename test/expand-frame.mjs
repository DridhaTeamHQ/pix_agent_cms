/* ── The geometry behind a generative expand ─────────────────────────────────

   Run: node test/expand-frame.mjs

   Expand is the feature that shipped broken twice, and both times the fault
   was the same shape: the model was ASKED, in prose, to place the photograph
   inside a larger frame, and it answered by drawing the photograph as an
   object — a framed print, hard white border and all — sitting in a scene it
   invented around it. Two posters went out that way.

   The fix is that placement stopped being a request. The browser composites
   the picture onto a frame of exactly the size the server resolved, sends an
   alpha mask that is opaque over the picture, and pastes the source back over
   whatever returns. None of that is negotiable by the model, and none of it
   needs an API key to check — it is arithmetic, which is the whole point.

   So this file holds the guarantees to the wall:

     the picture fits          a placement that runs off the edge of the frame
                               is a crop, and cropping is the opposite of the
                               job expand exists to do
     more pull-back is smaller a "wide" expand that fills more of the frame
                               than a "slight" one has the control backwards
     never blown up            the output is a fixed size, so scaling past
                               contain spends resolution to gain nothing
     people get room BELOW     a subject cut at the chest needs the torso, not
                               empty sky over their head
     the mask covers the photo transparent means "you may paint here". If the
                               opaque rectangle does not sit inside the
                               picture, the model is being invited to repaint
                               the picture, which is exactly the bug
     the source is pasted back layer 4 is the only actual guarantee in the
                               pipeline: hard-edged, pixel-exact, at the rect

/* ── The part the card actually shows ────────────────────────────────────

   Everything above proves the photograph lands whole inside the file the
   model returns. That was never the same claim as landing whole on the
   poster, and the gap between the two is where an expand could come back
   correct and still arrive with a person cut off at the edge.

   gpt-image sells 1024x1536 for a 9:16 card. The card is 920x1700. Cover
   scaling clips the difference — about a fifth of the width, a quarter once
   the pan headroom is in — and the photograph, placed at contain scale, was
   the thing sitting across that boundary. The generated margin, drawn for
   exactly this purpose, was in the middle where nothing was cutting it.

   So the assertions here re-implement drawCoverImage rather than call
   posterVisibleRect() twice. If the placement's idea of the visible area and
   the renderer's ever diverge, that is the bug this section exists to catch,
   and asking one of them to check itself would not catch it. */

/* ── The photograph comes back at the writer's resolution ────────────────

   The source is downscaled to 1536px because that is the most gpt-image will
   accept as INPUT. Layer 4 pastes it back without consulting the model, so
   there was never a reason for the paste-back to inherit the API's limit —
   and while it did, the card showed an 830px photograph stretched over a
   920px frame and the 4x export invented three quarters of its pixels.

   The first attempt at fixing that scaled the composite and pasted the
   original hard-edged at 1:1 over a margin interpolated 1.54x, with an 11px
   feather between them: a smear across the sky. For a while the answer was
   "no scale, ever", which gave back the downscale — a 4000px photograph
   returned at 830px, reported as "it is not upscaling".

   The honest version has both halves. The composite IS built at the
   photograph's scale (nativeComposeScale), and the original goes in as a
   fifth layer through an alpha ramp a good way wide, over layer 4 — the same
   picture at the margin's softness. Sharp fades into soft inside the
   photograph, where its own detail carries the slope, and there is no line
   at the border for the eye to find. These pin that contract. */
